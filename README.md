# updated-horiseon-site

## Description

This is our first challenge in web development bootcamp. I have updated the "Starter-code" Ithat I copied from "Develop" folder. To complete my homework, I followed the class guidelines and watched the recordings for better understanding.

- My motivation to finish my homework was to check my understanding.
- It is updating an existing webpage.


## Installation

- To complete this homework, I had to install git, git bash, VSCode etc and follow class lectures. 

## Usage

I used a lot of git commands like :
git status
git add -A
git commit -m "Comment goes here"
git branch
git push
git pull origin main
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/add-branch
